# Note Writing Robot

ðŸ¤– *Project*: Note Writing Robot  
ðŸ”¹ *Tech Stack*: Arduino, Arduino IDE, GCode Sender, IoT  

## Overview
Our Note Writing Robot project, developed for the TCC1 course, demonstrates robotic automation through precise handwriting replication. By integrating an Arduino microcontroller, various sensors, and the GCode Sender extension, this robot is capable of automating the creative task of writing notes. This project showcases our skills in IoT, hardware integration, and robotics.

## Features
- *Automated Note Writing*: Programs the robot to write notes with accuracy and consistency.
- *GCode Control*: Uses GCode Sender to send precise writing commands to the robot.
- *Hardware Integration*: Combines sensors and actuators with Arduino for smooth and controlled movements.

## Tech Stack
- *Arduino*: Controls the robot's movements and integrates sensor input.
- *GCode Sender*: Sends coded instructions for precise note-writing commands.
- *IoT*: Enables connectivity and potential remote control capabilities.

## How It Works
1. *Programming*: The GCode Sender is used to program specific writing patterns.
2. *Movement Control*: Arduino and sensors coordinate to execute writing motions.
3. *Note Writing*: The robot replicates handwritten notes based on programmed patterns.

## Installation
1. *Arduino Setup*:
   - Install the Arduino IDE and upload the movement control code to the Arduino.
2. *GCode Sender*:
   - Install GCode Sender and connect to the Arduino.
   - Upload writing patterns in GCode format.
3. *Run the Project*:
   - Start the robot and monitor its note-writing process.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve handwriting accuracy.
- Explore additional automation for other writing styles or fonts.
